# Caltech_AY119_2016_ex_coins

#### We will collect here student solutions to the exercise related to counting ways to pay amounts using fixed denominations.

1. Write a program to count number of ways to split an amount using coins of denominations 1,5,10,25
2. For numbers 1 through 100, sum those for which the answer to the first question is an odd number
3. Is it odd or even?

* Use any language. More than one (separately) is fine too
* Use the following format for names: coins_&lt;yourGithandle&gt;.&lt;langExt&gt;
* Feel free to interact with others
* Use proper Git protocols (branch, modify, pull_requests etc.)

Avoid programming by instinct.
Have fun :-)
